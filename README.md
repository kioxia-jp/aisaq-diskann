# AiSAQ-DiskANN

AiSAQ (All-in-Storage ANNS with Product Quantization) is a DRAM-free method for approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS).
This code forked off from [code for Microsoft DiskANN](https://github.com/Microsoft/DiskANN) algorithm.

### AiSAQ-DiskANN includes the following enhancements:
1. Scalable, DRAM-free search - The PQ vectors are not loaded into DRAM during disk-index-search, instead they are being read from the media on demand.
2. Inline PQ vectors - Some or all PQ vectors may be stored as part of the index node, saving IOs during search.
3. Vectors rearrangement - Optimal rearrangement of the vectors in a way that the number of IOs needed to read the PQ vectors from the media during greedy search will be minimal.
4. Multiple entry points - Generate multiple entry points in a way that the query search will start from a closer point. 
5. Vector beamwidth - Tune the number of nodes that are expended on each greedy search iteration, this will parallelize PQ vectors read IOs.
6. Greedy search algorithm improvements.
7. Static PQ vectors cache - Common static cache of PQ vectors, populated during load prior search.
8. Dynamic PQ vectors read cache - A dynamic page level read cache of PQ vectors, managed per-thread using LRU eviction policy.


The usage of our additional AiSAQ indices is described below:

DiskANN is a suite of scalable, accurate and cost-effective approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms for large-scale vector search that support real-time changes and simple filters.
This code is based on ideas from the [DiskANN](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9527-rand-nsg-fast-accurate-billion-point-nearest-neighbor-search-on-a-single-node.pdf), [Fresh-DiskANN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09613) and the [Filtered-DiskANN](https://harsha-simhadri.org/pubs/Filtered-DiskANN23.pdf) papers with further improvements.

## Linux build:

Install the following packages through apt-get

```bash
sudo apt install make cmake g++ libaio-dev libgoogle-perftools-dev clang-format libboost-all-dev
```

### Install Intel MKL
#### Ubuntu 20.04 or newer
```bash
sudo apt install libmkl-full-dev
```

#### Earlier versions of Ubuntu
Install Intel MKL either by downloading the [oneAPI MKL installer](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl.html) or using [apt](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/installing-intel-free-libs-and-python-apt-repo) (we tested with build 2019.4-070 and 2022.1.2.146).

```
# OneAPI MKL Installer
wget https://registrationcenter-download.intel.com/akdlm/irc_nas/18487/l_BaseKit_p_2022.1.2.146.sh
sudo sh l_BaseKit_p_2022.1.2.146.sh -a --components intel.oneapi.lin.mkl.devel --action install --eula accept -s
```

### Build
```bash
mkdir build && cd build && cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. && make -j 
```

## Windows build:

The Windows version has been tested with Enterprise editions of Visual Studio 2022, 2019 and 2017. It should work with the Community and Professional editions as well without any changes. 

**Prerequisites:**

* CMake 3.15+ (available in VisualStudio 2019+ or from https://cmake.org)
* NuGet.exe (install from https://www.nuget.org/downloads)
    * The build script will use NuGet to get MKL, OpenMP and Boost packages.
* DiskANN git repository checked out together with submodules. To check out submodules after git clone:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

* Environment variables: 
    * [optional] If you would like to override the Boost library listed in windows/packages.config.in, set BOOST_ROOT to your Boost folder.

**Build steps:**
* Open the "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019" (or corresponding version) and change to DiskANN folder
* Create a "build" directory inside it
* Change to the "build" directory and run
```
cmake ..
```
OR for Visual Studio 2017 and earlier:
```
<full-path-to-installed-cmake>\cmake ..
```
**This will create a diskann.sln solution**. Now you can:

- Open it from VisualStudio and build either Release or Debug configuration.
- `<full-path-to-installed-cmake>\cmake --build build`
- Use MSBuild:
```
msbuild.exe diskann.sln /m /nologo /t:Build /p:Configuration="Release" /property:Platform="x64"
```

* This will also build gperftools submodule for libtcmalloc_minimal dependency.
* Generated binaries are stored in the x64/Release or x64/Debug directories.
